# Applications-for-thermogram-analysis-
I have created this application as an output of my diploma thesis. It is designed for general themogram analysis of 1 thermogram and also
for time analysis of 2-5 thermograms. If you are interested in more details hit me up with an email: veronika.rem5@gmail.com.
