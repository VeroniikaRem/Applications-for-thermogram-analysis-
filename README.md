# Applications-for-thermogram-analysis-
I created this application as an output of my diploma thesis. It is designed for general themogram analysis of 1 thermogram and also
for time analysis of 2-5 thermograms. If you are interested in more details hit me up with an email: veronika.rem5@gmail.com.
"Readme file" is inside the install file in Czech langue. If you are non-native speaker, there is also video guide to show you how to use this application.
In file called "thermograms", there are some thermograms you can use to test this application.
